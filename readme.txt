==========================
Version 1.0 (tested with Sweetcron 1.08e)

Thanks for downloading this Sweetcron theme! We know your blog posts are important to you. We also know you're probably an active internet geek much like we are. In the world of Sweetcron, this doesn't fair well for your blog posts.

Never fear - teh blog ar (not) dead will give your blog posts the spotlight they deserve!

Features
--------
* Dedicated area for blog items
* Expandable profile section
* Activity items link directly to original source
* Clean customizable single column layout

NOTE
----
This theme was created pre-1.08c, when there was no easy way to make custom queries and isolate blog items from the rest. Version 1.08e SHOULD provide an adequate solution to this, making this theme's approach somewhat outdated (we know, our timing is impeccable).
